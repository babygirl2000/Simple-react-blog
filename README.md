# Getting Started with Create React App

This is My first react app which is a project thats about viewing blog post and the user can add new blog post.

This project uses react hooks `useEffect` and `useState`
In this project  local json server was setup for a local API.
In this project i also created  custom hook `useFetch`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`
Activates the json server to port 8000
