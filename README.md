# Getting Started Blog Post React App

This is My first react app which is a project thats about viewing blog post. So basically the user can click on blog past to view more details about the blog. 
The user can add or delete blog posts too.

This project uses react hooks `useEffect` and `useState`
In this project  local json server was setup for a local API.
In this project i also created  custom hook `useFetch`. 
I also learnt about react router and used v5



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`
Activates the json server to port 8000
